description: Create a detailed implementation plan.

Briefly analyze my feature request, then ask me 3 questions to clarify the requirements. Only then start the planning workflow.

Once the user answers, **generate the plan strictly following the structure below**:

<!-- {{file:../chatmodes/plan-template.md}} -->

[implementation plan template](..\chatmodes\plan-template.md)

The plan must use these headings exactly and fill each section appropriately based on the user’s answers.
