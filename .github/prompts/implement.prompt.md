# TDD Feature Implementation

Follow this workflow:

1. Read and understand the plan.
2. Summarize your understanding before coding.
3. Start by generating **test cases first** based on the acceptance criteria and tasks in the plan.
4. Implement a single task or step from an existing implementation plan.
5. Implement the minimal code required to make the tests pass.
6. Refactor as needed while keeping all tests green.
<!-- 7. Generate complete Angular files, including components, services, and templates, using standalone APIs and signals. -->

**Instructions:**

- Use the project standards from [copilot-instructions.md](../copilot-instructions.md)
<!-- - Ensure accessibility and i18n compliance.
- Use the TDD loop: `Write test → Implement → Verify → Refactor`.
- Adhere strictly to the architecture described in the plan.
- Use the naming and patterns defined in the project’s standards. -->

Now, implement the feature described in the plan below.
